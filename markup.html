            <a href="/">Molly</a> had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of Nature, New Scientist, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of On The Road. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
